# Icon Index
Icon Index is a index of icons from web icon packs. The goal is to make it easier to find packs containing the icons 
you want in the styles you want. This type of icon are completely un-indexed (apart from on their creators' website) 
so it's hopefully a useful tool. Feedback and comments are more than welcome.

Please note that I have no affiliation with any of the icon packs I index.

Icon Index currently supports searching icons by keyword and/or framework. Additionally, it offers two advanced options powered by 
<a href="https://fusejs.io/">fuse.js</a>: extended search, which uses simple regex-like syntax for more advanced queries (see 
<a href="https://fusejs.io/examples.html#extended-search">examples on the fuse.js website</a>), and fuzzy match which matches icons containing substrings of the search term.

It's a simple HTML/CSS/JS app with a node.js backend, using fuse.js for search, and hosted on AWS. Thoughts and contributions welcome.
